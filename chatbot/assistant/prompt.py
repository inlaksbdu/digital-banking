ABOUT_THE_BANK = """
Consolidated Bank of Kenya (CBK) is a government‑owned commercial bank established on 7 December 1989 to stabilize Kenya's financial sector by merging nine insolvent institutions.  It is now 93.4% owned by the National Treasury (through the Deposit Protection Fund).  CBK's culture emphasizes flexibility, innovation and customer focus, especially serving SMEs with personalized financial solutions.  The bank's vision is *"To be the Bank of choice offering pleasant and convenient services"* and its mission is *"to provide flexible financial solutions that support our customers achieve success."*.  CBK offers a broad range of services: personal and business banking (current and savings accounts, fixed deposits, loans and mortgages), trade finance (bonds, invoice/bill discounting, letters of credit, etc.), treasury products, and digital banking (internet/mobile banking).

## Accounts and Cards Offered

CBK offers both **personal** and **business** banking products.  Personal banking accounts include multiple current and savings options: for example, Pay-As-You-Go and Ace Salary *Current Accounts*, foreign-currency accounts, and specialized accounts like "Account 99" for students.  Transactional accounts include *E-Cash*, *Solid Plus* and *Schools Collection* accounts.  Savings products include *Dream Saver*, *Junior Saver*, *Diamond Saver* and *Vuna Chama* savings accounts.  Fixed‑term deposits are also available.  Business banking accounts include a *Business Current Account* and group accounts, alongside business loans and trade finance products.  (A full list of accounts is on CBK's website under Products.)

The bank issues **ATM/debit cards** linked to these accounts.  Debit card customers have standard daily limits (currently KES 40,000 ATM withdrawal; KES 100,000 POS/point-of-sale).  (Per the official tariff schedule, initial ATM card issuance is free; replacing a lost/damaged card costs KES 500, and PIN replacement costs KES 50.)  The FAQ notes that an ATM card is ready in 7 working days (PIN sent to the customer's phone).  At expiry or request, customers can visit any branch to receive a new card.  If a card is **lost or stolen**, customers must immediately call the bank (toll-free 0800 720039 or +254 703 016 016, or WhatsApp +254 729 111 637) or email support to stop the card.  A replacement card will then be issued at a branch (with the KES 500 replacement fee).  Forgotten ATM PINs or swallowed cards require ordering a new card (no PIN reissue).  *(The bank's FAQ has full details on these procedures.)*

## Branch and ATM Locations

Consolidated Bank maintains branches in Nairobi and in many major Kenyan towns.  Key branches include: Nairobi (Head Office – Consolidated Bank House, 23 Koinange St; plus outlets at Harambee Avenue/Agriculture House, Umoja, River Road, Embakasi, Kitengela, etc.), Mombasa (Consolidated Bank Building, Nkrumah Rd), Nakuru (Belpar House, Kenyatta St), Nyeri (Konahauthi House, Kimathi St), Eldoret (Santuri Court, Kenyatta St), Embu (Consolidated Bank Bldg, Kenyatta Hwy), Meru (Meru County Maisonnettes, Tom Mboya St), Murang'a (Union Bank Bldg, Kenyatta Ave), Laare (Kamukunji Bldg, Laare Mutwatsi Rd), Isiolo (Consolidated House, Kenyatta Hwy), plus branches in Thika, Maua, Gatundu and other towns (see CBK website for full list).

Most branch locations have CBK ATMs on site.  The bank's ATMs are integrated into Kenya's national ATM networks (Kenswitch), so customers can withdraw funds at CBK and partner ATMs countrywide.  For example, CBK operates ATMs at its head office and other branches (e.g. Agriculture House on Harambee Ave, Nairobi; Consolidated Bank House, Embu; Consolidated House, Mombasa; etc.), with a branch locator/ATM finder on the official site.

## Customer Service Policies (Card Issuance & Cancellation)

CBK's customer service charters and FAQs outline the procedures for card issuance and cancellation.  As noted, new ATM cards are issued within 7 business days of application.  Upon expiry, customers may renew their card at any branch (even up to one month before expiration).  In case of loss or theft, the card must be reported immediately by calling the bank's support lines or sending an email; the card will be blocked ("stopped") and a replacement can be issued at a branch.  (Stopping a card via the mobile banking app is also free.)  There is a fee (KES 500) for replacing a lost/damaged ATM card, and KES 50 for PIN replacement.  For any service queries or complaints, customers can also contact the Call Center (see above) or visit any branch to invoke the bank's published complaint-handling procedure.
